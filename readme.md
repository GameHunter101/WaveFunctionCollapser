# Wave Function Collapse ðŸŒŠðŸ’¥

## What does it do?

My implementation of the Wave Function Collapse algorithm by [mxgmn](https://github.com/mxgmn/WaveFunctionCollapse)

Import custom tiles, define valid states, and run the algorithm!

Uses my custom game engine and renderer [GameZap](https://github.com/GameHunter101/gamezap-lib)
